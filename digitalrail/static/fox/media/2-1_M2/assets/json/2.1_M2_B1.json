            "content": "The red fox is an omnivore. It primarily feeds on small rodents but will also target birds, rabbits, reptiles, racoons, insects, and fish. Foxes will readily eat plant materials including berries, apples, grapes, acorns, grasses, and tubers. This versatility allows them to thrive in environments across the Northern Hemisphere, from the Artic Circle through the United States and Canada, in Europe, Asia, and even Australia. An adult fox requires about 18 oz. of food daily but will continue to hunt even when it's full, storing extra food in caches under leaves, snow, or dirt.",

The vocal range of the fox spans five octaves, with twelve unique sounds having been identified, including barks, growls, yelps, and whines.",

It stalks its prey, crouching low to the ground and using its keen sense of hearing and, scientists now believe, the Earth's magnetic field to precisely pinpoint the animal's exact location, even under three feet of snow. It then leaps into the air a distance of up to 25 feet and strikes from above, a technique called mousing.",
