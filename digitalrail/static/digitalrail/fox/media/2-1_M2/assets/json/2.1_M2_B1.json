There is no way to tell exactly when or how writing emerged in China, but we do have evidence of a fully functioning writing system by the second half of the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC). These fragments of shell and bone only show a few characters, once part of longer inscriptions. These pieces were used in rituals to try to foretell the future, so they are known as “oracle bones.”",

The king used oracle bones like these to consult his ancestors and to ask them to serve as intemediaries to the high god, Di, and to the powers of rivers, mountains, rain, and thunder. A Shang king’s ability to contact supernatural powers reinforced his political power. The king’s authority depended in part on his ability to speak to his ancestors on behalf of the community.",
