The shoulder blades, or scapulae, from cattle or the front of turtle shells, or plastrons, were cleaned and polished on one side. The other side had small pits bored in rows, as seen here, for the divination described in the next entry."

            "content": "When a king or his diviner inserted a heated thorn or piece of metal into one of the pits bored into the bones, the bone cracked, making a \"puk\" sound, which was believed to be the voice of the ancestor being questioned.The king then interpreted the shape of the crack as a lucky or auspicious answer to his question, or an unlucky or inauspicious answer. The Chinese character for the verb “to divine” (卜) mimics the shape of a crack on an oracle bone.",

Sometimes, they recorded the eventual outcome as well. For instance, if the king asked about the weather and interpreted the crack as auspicious, a later inscription, called the “verification,” might record whether the weather actually was good. Thousands of these oracle bone inscriptions have been recovered, giving scholars a picture of day-to-day life in the king’s household.",
